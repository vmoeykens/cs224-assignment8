### Running
This program prompts for an input txt file. The file must be space delimited integers where a single line indicates a list of integers to be sorted and the inversions counted. For example: 
```
1 13 14 2 25 26
45 23 12 34 10
```

Will run the algorithm twice, the first time on the first line's list of integers, and the second time on the second line's list of integers.
